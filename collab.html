            <p>I have always wanted to go to the Hajj and perform one of the most important duty Allah has bestowed upon me. That's why i have written the part on hajj. I have focused on the merits of hajj, shed light upon the steps that we have to perform during Hajj and mentioned some verses from the Holy Quran and hadith. I hope my work will help many in the process of Hajj through the step by step guide.</p>

            <p>By the grace of Allah, we have successfully completed the course of Usrah Budi. I wished to have physical class as it is more engaging to discuss about Islam. The syllabus could include more in depth about the topics, discussion on some surah, their history and so on.  </p>
